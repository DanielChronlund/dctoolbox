# ENTRA ID Conditional Access Policy Simulator

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a simulator to evaluate conditional access (CA) policies. The simulator will help identify vulnerability gaps in the policies, test them using test cases, and visualize the policy set.


## Project Period
**Fall (September-January)**

## Key Steps
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Set up a trial Entra ID tenant and create CA policies.
2. **Build Toolbox:**
   - Export policies from the Entra ID tenant.
   - Evaluate test cases against a policy set.
   - Generate conditions that do not hit any policy in the set.
   - Generate summarized descriptions for each policy.
   - Visualize the policy set.
3. **Present Results:**
   - Present findings and results.

## Deliverables
- Initial Plan
- Mid-term Report(s)
- Final Report
- Two presentations at school
- A software solution with source code and a demo

## Special Notes
- Review partial solutions available on GitHub before starting. 
- The toolbox should be usable from GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and documentation generation.
- For debugging a parameter called 'ToggleVerbosePrinting' can be enabled in the code for extra command line printing
